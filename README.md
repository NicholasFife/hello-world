# hello-world

Hello, I'm Nicholas Fife
In 2018 I decided to begin pursuing Video Games as a career.
In November 2020 I graduated with a B.S. in Game Design.
When I first started studying, I expected I'd want to go into Narrative Design. 
I love stories no matter the medium and am a published writer. 
But I quickly grew to love the puzzle presented by coding.

My primary foci are Level and System Design.
I'm most confident working with C# in Unity,
however I also have experience working with C++ in UE4.
